### Work Experience 

[Datalogy](/pdf/Internship.pdf)
<br>
 Intern
 <br>
• Worked with real-world data from the company to predict the performances of various courses offered by company.
<br>
• To gain insights, I used a variety of data exploration techniques using scipy,pandas,numpy,seaborn,matplotlib libraries in python.
<br>
• Different classification and regression machine learning techniques were implemented with optimization using sklearn library .
<br>
• Extracted useful insights from raw data and assisted the company with their client targeting and products .

[JNCASR Bangalore ](/pdf/Prudhvi_Letter.pdf)
<br>
Research Intern
<br>
• Worked on a Statistical Mechanics problem using scipy,numpy,pandas,matplotlib libraries in Python under professor Subir K Das.
<br>
• Wrote a Scientific Model to efficiently predict the phase separation mechanism of a mixture when quenched to a low temperature using Mean Field Approximation of Ising Models.
<br>
• Achieved two phase separation mechanisms Spinodal Decomposition and Nucleation and employed Monte Carlo Algorithm to attain better performance.

### PROJECTS

- [Unpaired Image to Image Translation with Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/predator-1-ml/Pix2Pix)
<br>
    The Pix2PixCGAN was built using U-Net architercure, 30x30 patch GAN architecture. This CGAN converts raw satellite images to goolge map style images.
<br>
- [Review Classification of Amazon Fine Food using Decision Tree and Random Forest](https://github.com/Prudhvipvp/Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests)
<br>
     Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier was learned and the least error model was chosen by testing the model with varying hyperparameters.
<br>
- [Image captioning with Attention](https://github.com/predator-1-ml/Image-Captioning-using-attention)
<br>
     Implemented a encoder-decoder sequence to sequence model with Bahdanau's attention for translation of Spanish sentences to English sentences.
<br>
- [Generative Chat bot](https://github.com/predator-1-ml/Generative-Chat-bot)
<br>
     Developed a chat bot which generates output from the input text. Graphical user interface was built using tkinter library in python.
<br>
- [Art generation using Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/predator-1-ml/Art-generation-)
<br>
     The pretrained VGG19 model was used. The NST algorithm is used to transform content pictures into well-known art images.
<br>
- [Other Projects]
<br>
     1. Built a deep convolution neural network from scratch to classifiy the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.

<br>
     2. Implemented a deep neural network for traffic sign classification with an accuracy of 95 percent.
