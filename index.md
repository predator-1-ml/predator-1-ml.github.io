### PROJECTS

- [Unpaired Image to Image Translation with Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/predator-1-ml/Pix2Pix)
<br>
    The Pix2PixCGAN was built using U-Net architecture, and 30x30 patch GAN architecture. This CGAN converts raw satellite images to google map style images.
<br>
- [Review Classification of Amazon Fine Food using Decision Tree and Random Forest](https://github.com/Prudhvipvp/Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests)
<br>
     Decision Tree Classifier and random Forest Classifier were learned and the least error model was chosen by testing the model with varying hyperparameters.
<br>
- [Image captioning with Attention](https://github.com/predator-1-ml/Image-Captioning-using-attention)
<br>
     Implemented an encoder-decoder sequence-to-sequence model with Bahdanau's attention for translation of Spanish sentences to English sentences.
<br>
- [Generative Chat bot](https://github.com/predator-1-ml/Generative-Chat-bot)
<br>
