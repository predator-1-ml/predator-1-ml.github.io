### Work Experience 

[Datalogy](/pdf/Internship.pdf)
<br>
 Intern
 <br>
• Worked with real-world data from the company to predict the performances of various courses offered by company.
<br>
• To gain insights, I used a variety of data exploration techniques using scipy,pandas,numpy,seaborn,matplotlib libraries in python.
<br>
• Different classification and regression machine learning techniques were implemented with optimization using sklearn library .
<br>
• Extracted useful insights from raw data and assisted the company with their client targeting and products .

[JNCASR Bangalore ](/pdf/Prudhvi_Letter.pdf)
<br>
Research Intern
<br>
• Worked on a Statistical Mechanics problem using computer simulation with Python, Jupyter Notebook under professor Subir K Das.
<br>
• Wrote a Scientific Model to efficiently predict the phase separation mechanism of a mixture when quenched to a low temperature using Mean Field Approximation of Ising Models to perform this task.
<br>
• Achieved two phase separation mechanisms Spinodal Decomposition and Nucleation and employed Monte Carlo Algorithm to attain better results.

### PROJECTS

- [Unpaired Image to Image Translation with Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/predator-1-ml/Pix2Pix)
<br>
     The Pix2PixGAN was used to convert satellite images to Google Maps type images.
     
<br>
     The generator is based on a U-Net architecture with decoder and encoder, and the discriminator is based on a 30*30 Patch GAN architecture. In the generator, there were skip connections between encoder and decoder.Batch normalisation was used in this study.
<br>  
     The model is optimized using Mean Squared Error, Sigmoid Cross Entropy loss functions for the generator, and the sum of Sigmoid Cross Entropy losses for the discriminator.The model has been trained for 200 epochs, and the results are very good
<br>
- [Review Classification of Amazon Fine Food using Decision Tree and Random Forest](https://github.com/Prudhvipvp/Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests)
<br>
     Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier was learned and the least error model was chosen by testing the model with varying hyperparameters.
<br>
- [Neural Machine Translation with Attention](https://github.com/Prudhvipvp/Neural-Machine-Translation)
<br>
     Implemented a encoder-decoder sequence to sequence model with Bahdanau's attention for translation of Spanish sentences to English sentences.
<br>
- [Other Projects](https://github.com/Prudhvipvp/Other-Projects)
<br>
     1. Built a feed forward neural network (2 Hidden Layered) from scratch to classifiy the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
<br>
     2. Built a Canny Edge Detector from scratch in python to detect wide range of edges in images.
<br>
     3. Implemented a deep neural network for traffic sign classification with an accuracy of 95 percent.
