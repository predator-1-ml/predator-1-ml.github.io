### Work Experience 

[National Taipei University of Technology](/pdf/Intern.jpeg)
<br>
 Intern
 <br>
• Worked on a Large Parking Station Management System for the China Motor Corporation(CMC) under professor Leehter Yao.
<br>
• Wrote a program to efficiently schedule the charging interval of a vehicle in the parking lot based on its departure time and current battery
charge status of the vehicle. Linear Programming with the GLPK library was used to perform this task.
<br>
• Designed a website application that shows the status of the Parking lot(Number of Vehicles, their current Battery Charge etc).
<br>
• Worked on CANBUS to enable the communication between the Battery management system and the charge management system.

<br>
Research Intern
<br>
• Worked on a Research Project in Virtual Reality(VR) under Dr Jarrod Knibbe to predict pointing behaviour during room-scale target selection.
<br>
• The working prototype consisted of 27 targets in 3D Virtual Space and users were asked to point those targets.
<br>
• Developed an SVM model to predict/early predict the target in real-time, given the coordinates of the index finger during the flight.
<br>
• Using these prediction models, we aim to better understand how users point in Virtual Reality and facilitate early target prediction.

### PROJECTS

- [Unpaired Image to Image Translation with Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/predator-1-ml/Pix2Pix)
<br>
     The Pix2PixGAN was used to convert satellite images to Google Maps type images.
     
<br>
     The generator is based on a U-Net architecture with decoder and encoder, and the discriminator is based on a 30*30 Patch GAN architecture. In the generator, there were skip connections between encoder and decoder.Batch normalisation was used in this study.
<br>  
     The model is optimized using Mean Squared Error, Sigmoid Cross Entropy loss functions for the generator, and the sum of Sigmoid Cross Entropy losses for the discriminator.The model has been trained for 200 epochs, and the results are very good
<br>
- [Review Classification of Amazon Fine Food using Decision Tree and Random Forest](https://github.com/Prudhvipvp/Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests)
<br>
     Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier was learned and the least error model was chosen by testing the model with varying hyperparameters.
<br>
- [Neural Machine Translation with Attention](https://github.com/Prudhvipvp/Neural-Machine-Translation)
<br>
     Implemented a encoder-decoder sequence to sequence model with Bahdanau's attention for translation of Spanish sentences to English sentences.
<br>
- [Other Projects](https://github.com/Prudhvipvp/Other-Projects)
<br>
     1. Built a feed forward neural network (2 Hidden Layered) from scratch to classifiy the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
<br>
     2. Built a Canny Edge Detector from scratch in python to detect wide range of edges in images.
<br>
     3. Implemented a deep neural network for traffic sign classification with an accuracy of 95 percent.
