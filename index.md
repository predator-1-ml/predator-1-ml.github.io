### Work Experience 
**Deep Learning Intern | IIT BHU**
<br>
*Intern*
<br>
• Developed a deep learning model for predicting Covid cases and segmentation of the Covid region.
<br>
• Employed Transfer Learning technique to extract features from pre-trained networks like ResNet50,InceptionResNetV2, and EfficientNet.
<br>
• Adapted different classification algorithms such as SVC, Random Forest, XGBoost, Neural Network.
<br>
• Used data set of more than 10,000 pictures and obtained 99.9% accuracy with X-ray images and 99.4% with CT scans. The Covid region in the lungs was segmented with a 75% accuracy rate.

### PROJECTS

- [Unpaired Image to Image Translation with Pix2Pix Generative Adversarial Networks](https://github.com/predator-1-ml/Pix2Pix)
<br>
    The Pix2PixCGAN was built using U-Net architercure, 30x30 patch GAN architecture. This CGAN converts raw satellite images to goolge map style images.
<br>
- [Review Classification of Amazon Fine Food using Decision Tree and Random Forest](https://github.com/Prudhvipvp/Decision-Trees-and-Random-Forests)
<br>
     Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier was learned and the least error model was chosen by testing the model with varying hyperparameters.
<br>
- [Image captioning with Attention](https://github.com/predator-1-ml/Image-Captioning-using-attention)
<br>
     Implemented a encoder-decoder sequence to sequence model with Bahdanau's attention for translation of Spanish sentences to English sentences.
<br>
- [Generative Chat bot](https://github.com/predator-1-ml/Generative-Chat-bot)
<br>
     Developed a chat bot which generates output from the input text. Graphical user interface was built using tkinter library in python.
<br>
- [Art generation using Neural Style Transfer](https://github.com/predator-1-ml/Art-generation-)
<br>
     The pretrained VGG19 model was used. The NST algorithm is used to transform content pictures into well-known art images.
<br>
- [Other Projects](https://github.com/predator-1-ml/RecnozingHandDigits)
<br>
     1. Built a deep convolution neural network from scratch to classifiy the MNIST handwritten digits dataset.
<br>
     2. Implemented a deep neural network for traffic sign classification with an accuracy of 95 percent.
